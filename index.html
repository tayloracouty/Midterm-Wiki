				<p>Journalism is the production and distribution of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report">reports</a> on the interaction of events, facts, ideas, and people that are the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News">news</a> of the day" and that informs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society">society</a> to at least some degree. The word applies to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist">occupation</a> (professional or not), the methods of gathering information, and the organizing literary styles. Journalistic media include: print, television, radio, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>, and, in the past, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsreel">newsreels</a>.

				Concepts of the appropriate role for journalism varies between countries. In some nations, the news media is controlled by a government intervention, and is not a fully independent body.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism#cite_note-1">[1]</a> In others, the news media is independent from the government but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_motive">profit motive</a> is in tension with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution">constitutional</a> protections of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press">freedom of the press</a>. Access to freely available information gathered by independent and competing journalistic enterprises with transparent editorial standards can enable citizens to effectively participate in the political process. In the United States, journalism is protected by the freedom of the press clause in the First Amendment.

				The role and status of journalism, along with that of the mass media, has undergone changes over the last two decades with the advent of digital technology and publication of news on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism#cite_note-2">[2]</a> This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels, as people increasingly consume news through e-readers, smartphones, and other electronic devices, challenging news organizations to fully monetize their digital wing, as well as improvise on the context in which they publish news in print. Notably, in the American media landscape, newsrooms have reduced their staff and coverage as traditional media channels, such as television, grapple with declining audiences. For instance, between 2007 and 2012, CNN edited its story packages into nearly half of their original time length.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism#cite_note-3">[3]</a>

				This compactness in coverage has been linked to broad audience attrition, as a large majority of respondents in recent studies show changing preferences in news consumption.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism#cite_note-4">[4]</a> The digital era has also ushered in a new kind of journalism in which ordinary citizens play a greater role in the process of news making, with the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_journalism">citizen journalism</a> being possible through the Internet. Using video camera equipped smartphones, active citizens are now enabled to record footage of news events and upload them onto channels like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</a>, which is often discovered and used by mainstream news media outlets. Meanwhile, easy access to news from a variety of online sources, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blogs</a> and other social media, has resulted in readers being able to pick from a wider choice of official and unofficial sources, instead of only from traditional media organizations. Journalism is nonfiction.</p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<hr>
				<div class="article">
				<p>Journalistic conventions vary by country. In the United States, 	journalism is produced by media organizations or by individuals. Bloggers are often, but not always, journalists. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> requires that bloggers who receive free promotional gifts, then write about products, must disclose that they received the products for free. This is to eliminate conflicts of interest and protect consumers.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism#cite_note-5">[5]</a>

				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news_website">Fake news</a> is news that is not truthful or is produced by unreliable media organizations. Fake news is easily spread on social media. Readers can determine fake news by evaluating whether the news has been published by a credible news organization. In the US, a credible news organization is an incorporated entity; has an editorial board; and has a clear division between editorial and advertising departments. Credible news organizations, or their employees, belong to one or more professional organizations such as the American Society of News Editors, the Society of Professional Journalists, Investigative Reporters & Editors, or the Online News Association. All of these organizations have codes of ethics that members abide by. Many news organizations have their own codes of ethics that guide journalists' professional publications. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">New York Times</a> code of standards and ethics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism#cite_note-6">[6]</a> is considered particularly rigorous.

				When they write stories, journalists are concerned with issues of objectivity and bias. Some types of stories are intended to represent the author's own opinion; other types of stories are intended to be more neutral or balanced. In a physical newspaper, information is organized into sections and it is easy to see which stories are supposed to be opinion and which are supposed to be neutral. Online, many of these distinctions break down. Readers should pay careful attention to headings and other design elements to ensure that they understand the journalist's intent. Opinion pieces generally are written by regular columnists or appear in a section titled "Op-ed." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_story">Feature stories</a>, breaking news, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infotainment#V._journalism">hard news</a> stories are generally not opinion pieces.

				Many debates center on whether journalists are "supposed" to be "objective" or "neutral." The idea of "journalistic objectivity" is considered out of date. Journalists are people who produce news out of and as part of a particular social context. They are guided by professional codes of ethics and do their best to represent all legitimate points of view.</p>

		The recent rise of social media has resulted in arguments to reconsider journalism as a process rather than attributing it to particular news products. From this perspective, journalism is participatory, a process distributed among multiple authors and involving journalists as well as the socially mediating public.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism#cite_note-11">[11]</a></p>
